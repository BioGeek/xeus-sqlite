## Usage


## Installation

<!-- To ensure that the installation works, it is preferable to install `xeus` in a fresh conda environment. It is also needed to use a [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation because with the full [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) you may have a conflict.

The safest usage is to create an environment named `xeus-sqlite-env` within your miniconda installation

```bash
conda create -n xeus-sqlite-env
conda activate xeus-sqlite-env
conda install -c conda-forge xeus
```

Once you have installed ` xeus ` ,the  ` xeus-sqlite ` project is quite easy to install, you have to clone the repository, and run the following command lines :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX ..
make
make install
```
